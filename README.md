# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

In order for the app to start and fetch data properly, you will need to create
a `.env` file at the project root directory.

In the `.env` file add the following line `REACT_APP_API_KEY=api_key`, replace `api_key`
with the api key I have provided by email, the old api key was exposed on GitHub and
can be traced back through the commits, it's invalidated and I have generated a new one.

After that, run the command: `npm start`

This command will start a development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
